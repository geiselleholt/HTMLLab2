    <h1>History of Guhan</h1>
    <p>
      Guam has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. The indigenous
      people of Guam are known as the Chamorros, who are believed to have
      migrated to the island from Southeast Asia around 2000 B.C. The Chamorros
      lived in small villages and practiced fishing, farming, and other
      traditional activities. In the 16th century, Guam was colonized by Spain
      and remained under Spanish rule until 1898, when it was ceded to the
      United States after the Spanish-American War. Guam was occupied by Japan
      during World War II and was later recaptured by the United States. In
      1950, Guam became an unincorporated territory of the United States, and
      its residents were granted U.S. citizenship in 1952. Today, Guam is a
      popular tourist destination and a strategic military outpost for the U.S.
      military.
