The Chamorro people have a rich tradition of dance, music, and storytelling, which are passed down from generation to generation. Some of the most popular Chamorro traditions include the Inarajan Fiestan Tasi, a celebration of the sea, and the Festival of Pacific Arts, a gathering of artists and performers from around the Pacific region. Guam is also known for its delicious cuisine, which features a mix of Chamorro, Filipino, Japanese, and American dishes.
